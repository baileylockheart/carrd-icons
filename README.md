# Carrd Icons! [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2d5e7c9a-e892-4a61-b5d3-4185a830fae3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/carrd-icons/deploys)

The icons used in Carrd have always been one of its biggest appeals to me, and through ctrl+f'ing my way through the source code of my own Carrds, I've been using them in my websites for years now. My music website is probably my best example of this, but certainly not my only one.

In the past months, I've been making SO many things that I wanted to find a more convenient way to use these icons. I know how to use them via inline SVG, and I also figured out a relatively simple solution that requires a file download. Most recently, I've figured out a way to use a short link to connect the icons to a project, creating a simple and convenient way to use them!

Feel free to [check it out](https://carrd-icons.netlify.app) if you'd like to give it a try! Thanks for taking a look! :D
