# Carrd Icons! [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2d5e7c9a-e892-4a61-b5d3-4185a830fae3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/carrd-icons/deploys)

The icons used in Carrd have always been one of its biggest appeals to me, and through ctrl+f'ing my way through the source code of my own Carrds, I've been using them in my websites for years now. My music website is probably my best example of this, but certainly not my only one.

Recently, I've been making SO many things that I'm hoping to find a more convenient way to use these icons. I know how to use them via inline SVG, and I also figured out a relatively simple solution that requires a file download. Still though, I'd really like to be able to use them in a more convenient way, just setting up all the icons once, and being able to easily copy-paste a **SHORT** link into my code without downloads or issues. I'm not very knowledgeable of this stuff and its limitations, so I'm setting up some stuff here in hopes of figuring it out! 

As mentioned, there is a functional way to use these icons with relative ease, so long as you're willing to download a file and put it in the same folder as your website. Feel free to [check it out](https://carrd-icons.netlify.app) if you'd like to give it a try! Thanks for taking a look! :D
