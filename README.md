# carrd icons???
### HEY. HI, WELCOME IN. WELCOME TO THE STRUGGLE.

I've been making websites for almost two years now, and I initially taught myself how websites are built by browsing through the source code on websites I thought looked interesting. I didn't steal directly, but I learned enough to figure out that twitter has its own meta tags and img means image, y'know? I also looked through the source code of a carrd I had at the time, and that drew my attention to the cute symbols they used. Not images in the way I knew them, but SVG symbols. I used [this website](https://all-icons.carrd.co/) to collect up icons in order to use them for my sites! My music website is probably my best example of this, but certainly not my only one.

Now, though, I've been making SO many things that I'm hoping to find a more convenient way to use these icons. I know how to use them via inline SVG, and I even figured out some jQuerey things to link from another HTML document as long as it's in the same website. But again, I'd really like to be able to use them in a more convenient way, just setting up all the icons once, and being able to easily copy-paste a **SHORT** link into my code without issue. I'm not very knowledgeable of this stuff and its limitations, so I'm setting up some stuff here in hopes of figuring it out! thanks for taking a look! :D
